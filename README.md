# SSW_565
Final project for SSW 565

## Option 2:

OpenStack has been used for code review for many repositories. Allocating the code review tasks to code reviewers is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. It is important to categorize the type of code check-ins. Please take a look at https://review.opendev.org/ (Links to an external site.), export a list of more than 500 check-ins, or use the attached file (Code_Review_Project.csv  Download Code_Review_Project.csv)clustering each row/sample based on their architectural attributes, example, documentation related, performance improvement, test coverage or improve testability, security enhancement, etc.  The clustering methods can be simply keywords-based, machine learning-based, or any other approaches you would like to explore.

P1. Describe your findings regarding the statistics of the clusters, the percentage, variation, are there certain types of clusters that are difficult to detect?

P2. Is there any type of check-in that can be auto-evaluated or assisted by machine learning methods?

P3. Attached is a list of security-related check-ins Security_Code_Review_Project-1.csv  Download Security_Code_Review_Project-1.csv.  Please provide your opinion on further categorizing the check-ins within security-related features or observing how it interacts with other quality attributes, like performance, availability, modifiability, etc.  

Requirements:

3-5 Page technical report for answering at least one question in p1, p2, p3
Present all your work in a no longer than 5 minutes presentation.
